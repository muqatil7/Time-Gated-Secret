# Copy this file to `.env` and fill in the secrets for local development.
# Never commit your filled-in `.env` file.

# Optional: port for the Express server

# Primary Firebase service-account credentials (discrete vars)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=secret-time-7f086
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@secret-time-7f086.iam.gserviceaccount.com
# When storing the private key directly in .env, wrap it in quotes and replace newlines with \n
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nREPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_LINES\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# Alternative ways to provide credentials (use ONE of the following):
# 1) Full JSON inline (single line or escaped). Great for Vercel/Render.
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"secret-time-7f086",...}
# 2) Full JSON but base64-encoded (safer to paste in some dashboards):
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64=BASE64_ENCODED_JSON
# 3) Private key only as base64 (the app will decode):
# FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=BASE64_ENCODED_PEM
# 4) Path to JSON key file on disk (for local/dev servers):
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=../secrets/secret-time-7f086-service-account.json
